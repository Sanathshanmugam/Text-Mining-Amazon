       " \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

       " \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

       " \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

       " \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

       " \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

       "  \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

       "  \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant.

It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

       "  \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

       "  \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

       "  \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

       "  \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

       "  \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI have always liked black, this time by mistake I placed blue, but, it looks different, good. I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

       "  \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

       "  \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",

I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

       "  \"\\nCamera : Great. No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI have always liked black, this time by mistake I placed blue, but, it looks different, good. I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need.

Almost perfect colour, pitch black and almost 170° viewing angles.A day long battery life.What else do you need for entertainment?Probably nothing.The cameras are good at outdoor use and may struggle indoors.

But i bet it's awesome.**Overall this is the exact phone I needed. Mostly watching movies in high resolution and perfect picture quality and occasional multitasking.## Update the image stabilization on this phone is soo good, you can capture smooth videos and they are really good. Images are look good when taken outdoor and might struggle indoors if lightning is not good.So don't buy this phone if you wanna play games or do multitasking and complain in the review section.Think what you're gonna do with the phone and see the specs and then decide.\\n\",\n",

It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode...\n",

I have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage I would ask you to go for it, under 15K 6GB/128GB variant. Yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. It is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, UI is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000MAh battery to compensate and G20 processor need. Overall I am rating it 4 out of five.\\n\n",

price of  10,500rs. it can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 rs in camera department.battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)for 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)so, decent battery.remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high ppi consumes more battery.generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.display - very colourful, being amoled. but, only once i saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. but, that was only once. i hope it doesn\\'t occur again.edit : it happened because,  i removed some permissions from system apps. it never happened again.tip : try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.heating : i can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. but, it\\'s not much.want to know how much heat i feel? well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.performance : no issue as others are making it out to be. you can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. in daily usage it doesn\\'t lag.i have used sd 660 before, this has mtk g80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of sd660 or we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to sd 662.i didn\\'t play heavy games on this phone, but i did play games of about 2gb on my previous phone which had sd660. so, i think those games will work here without lag as well.tip : just because,  some people got defective piece doesn\\'t mean you will too. and if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. and for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot i uploaded)now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\\ni have always liked black, this time by mistake i placed blue, but, it looks different, good. i have not thoroughly tested it yet, but with my research and and bit of usage i would ask you to go for it, under 15k 6gb/128gb variant. yes it is not meant for gaming, yet quite good for video content experience. it is a functional device at this budget, ergonomic is up to mark, camera quality is decent, ui is smooth, tends to heat up, but natural as it has 6000mah battery to compensate and g20 processor need. overall i am rating it 4 out of five.\\n\\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\xa0before you buy m32 just think what type of user are you.i could see so many comments complaining about the performance of this phone. but m32 was not made for gaming or multitasking. it\\'s for people who use mobile for normal tasks rare multitasking and mostly for content viewing.simply it\\'s the best display for watching movies, videos and much more. no other display can show black better than a super amoled. almost perfect colour, pitch black and almost 170° viewing angles.a day long battery life.what else do you need for entertainment?probably nothing.the cameras are good at outdoor use and may struggle indoors. audio is more than enough both for calls and content viewing. wifi and sim signal depends on individual.***my mobile camera couldn\\'t capture the true colours of the display. but i

gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)for 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)so, decent battery.remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high ppi consumes more battery.generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.display - very colourful, being amoled. but, only once i saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. but, that was only once. i hope it doesn\\'t occur again.edit : it happened because,  i removed some permissions from system apps. it never happened again.tip : try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.heating : i can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. but, it\\'s not much.want to know how much heat i feel? well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.performance : no issue as others are making it out to be. you can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. in daily usage it doesn\\'t lag.i have used sd 660 before, this has mtk g80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of sd660 or we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to sd 662.i didn\\'t play heavy games on this phone, but i did play games of about 2gb on my previous phone which had sd660. so, i think those games will work here without lag as well.tip : just because,  some people got defective piece doesn\\'t mean you will too. and if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. and for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot i uploaded)now like my review, if you found it

rs in camera department.battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)for 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)so, decent battery.remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high ppi consumes more battery.generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.display - very colourful, being amoled. but, only once i saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. but, that was only once. i hope it doesn\\'t occur again.edit : it happened because,  i removed some permissions from system apps. it never happened again.tip : try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.heating : i can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. but, it\\'s not much.want to know how much heat i feel? well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.performance : no issue as others are making it out to be. you can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. in daily usage it doesn\\'t lag.i have used sd 660 before, this has mtk g80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of sd660 or we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to sd 662.i didn\\'t play heavy games on this phone, but i did play games of about 2gb on my previous phone which had sd660. so, i think those games will work here without lag as well.tip : just because,  some people got defective piece doesn\\'t mean you will too. and if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. and for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check

words for it\\'s outstanding performance at price of  10,500rs. it can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 rs in camera department.battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)for 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)so, decent battery.remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high ppi consumes more battery.generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.display - very colourful, being amoled. but, only once i saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. but, that was only once. i hope it doesn\\'t occur again.edit : it happened because,  i removed some permissions from system apps. it never happened again.tip : try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.heating : i can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. but, it\\'s not much.want to know how much heat i feel? well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.performance : no issue as others are making it out to be. you can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. in daily usage it doesn\\'t lag.i have used sd 660 before, this has mtk g80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of sd660 or we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to sd 662.i didn\\'t play heavy games on this phone, but i did play games of about 2gb on my previous phone which had sd660. so, i think those games will work here without lag as well.tip : just because,  some people got defective piece doesn\\'t mean you will too. and if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. and for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot i uploaded)now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\\ni have always liked

gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)for 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)so, decent battery.remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high ppi consumes more battery.generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.display - very colourful, being amoled. but, only once i saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. but, that was only once. i hope it doesn\\'t occur again.edit : it happened because,  i removed some permissions from system apps. it never happened again.tip : try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.heating : i can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. but, it\\'s not much.want to know how much heat i feel? well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.performance : no issue as others are making it out to be. you can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. in daily usage it doesn\\'t lag.i have used sd 660 before, this has mtk g80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of sd660 or we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to sd 662.i didn\\'t play heavy games on this phone, but i did play games of about 2gb on my previous phone which had sd660. so, i think those games will work here without lag as well.tip : just because,  some people got defective piece doesn\\'t mean you will too. and if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. and for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot i uploaded)now like my review, if you found it

outstanding performance at price of  10,500rs. it can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 rs in camera department.battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)for 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)so, decent battery.remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high ppi consumes more battery.generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.display - very colourful, being amoled. but, only once i saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. but, that was only once. i hope it doesn\\'t occur again.edit : it happened because,  i removed some permissions from system apps. it never happened again.tip : try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.heating : i can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. but, it\\'s not much.want to know how much heat i feel? well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.performance : no issue as others are making it out to be. you can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. in daily usage it doesn\\'t lag.i have used sd 660 before, this has mtk g80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of sd660 or we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to sd 662.i didn\\'t play heavy games on this phone, but i did play games of about 2gb on my previous phone which had sd660. so, i think those games will work here without lag as well.tip : just because,  some people got defective piece doesn\\'t mean you will too. and if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. and for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot i uploaded)now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\\ni have always liked black, this time by

once. i hope it doesn\\'t occur again.edit : it happened because,  i removed some permissions from system apps. it never happened again.tip : try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen

long time in low battery.performance : no issue as others are making it out to be. you can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. in daily usage it doesn\\'t lag.i have used sd 660 before, this has mtk g80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of sd660 or we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to sd 662.i didn\\'t play heavy games on this phone, but i did play games of about 2gb on my previous phone which had sd660. so, i think those games will work here without lag as well.tip : just because,  some people got defective piece doesn\\'t mean you will too. and if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. and for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot i uploaded)now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\\ni have always liked

beat smartphones upto 15,000 rs in camera department.battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)for 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)so, decent battery.remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high ppi consumes more battery.generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.display - very colourful, being amoled. but, only once i saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. but, that was only once. i hope it doesn\\'t occur again.edit : it happened because,  i removed some permissions from system apps. it never happened again.tip : try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.heating : i can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. but, it\\'s not much.want to know how much heat i feel? well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.performance : no issue as others are making it out to be. you can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. in daily usage it doesn\\'t lag.i have used sd 660 before, this has mtk g80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of sd660 or we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to sd 662.i didn\\'t play heavy games on this phone, but i did play games of about 2gb on my previous phone which had sd660. so, i think those games will work here without lag as well.tip : just because,  some people got defective piece doesn\\'t mean you will too. and if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. and for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for

time. but, it\\'s not much.want to know how much heat i feel? well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.performance : no issue as others are making it out to be. you can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. in daily usage it doesn\\'t lag.i have used sd 660 before, this has mtk g80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of sd660 or we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to sd 662.i didn\\'t play heavy games on this phone, but i did play games of about 2gb on my previous phone which had sd660. so, i think those games will work here without lag as well.tip : just because,  some people got defective piece doesn\\'t mean you will too. and if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. and for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot i uploaded)now like my review, if you found it helpful!\\n\\ni have always liked black, this time by

rs in camera department.battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)for 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)so, decent battery.remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high ppi consumes more battery.generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.display - very colourful, being amoled. but, only once i saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. but, that was only once. i hope it doesn\\'t occur again.edit : it happened because,  i removed some permissions from system apps. it never happened again.tip : try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.heating : i can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. but, it\\'s not much.want to know how much heat i feel? well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.performance : no issue as others are making it out to be. you can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. in daily usage it doesn\\'t lag.i have used sd 660 before, this has mtk g80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of sd660 or we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to sd 662.i didn\\'t play heavy games on this phone, but i did play games of about 2gb on my previous phone which had sd660. so, i think those games will work here without lag as well.tip : just because,  some people got defective piece doesn\\'t mean you will too. and if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. and for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check

sd660 or we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to sd 662.i didn\\'t play heavy games on this phone, but i did play games of about 2gb on my previous phone which had

needed. mostly watching movies in high resolution and perfect picture quality and occasional multitasking. update the image stabilization on this phone is soo good, you can capture smooth videos and
